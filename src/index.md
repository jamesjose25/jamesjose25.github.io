# Introduction

This book will guide you through setting up a localbuild of IIBv10 or ACEv11 starting from scratch. These instructions have been written based on my knowledge of the IIB/ACE build system and should be valid for any version of IIB v10 or ACE v11 on any of the supported platforms, however they have only been tested on macOS, Linux x64, Linux s390x, Linux ppcle, and Windows.

This guide is solely focused on getting a local IIB/ACE _server_ build. Specifically the following topics are outside the scope of this document:

1. The toolkit
1. The test material
1. All Node.js modules
1. Historical ODE build types, such as backing builds and delta builds
1. Any form of packager build (ibXXX, FixPackager or the z/OS USERMOD packager builds)
1. z/CX

When you're ready, head on over to [Getting setup](./setup/index.md) to begin!
