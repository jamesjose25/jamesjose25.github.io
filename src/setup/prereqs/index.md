# Prerequisite software

The ACE server build is quite complex and requires a number of prerequisite pieces to be built correctly. These requirements vary by major version and some of them vary by fix pack.

I have prepared instructions for the three major development platforms, please read the appropriate guide for your platform:

- [Linux](linux.md)
- [macOS](macos.md)
- [Windows](windows.md)

On some platforms (notably Windows) these setup steps can take a long time so you may wish to do them in parallel with setting up [RTC](../rtc/index.md)
