# RTC

Perhaps the most important part of a local build is the source code that forms the basis of your build! Currently the IIB/ACE server code is stored in RTC. The following instructions will get you started with RTC and create an appropriate workspace. Further RTC topics such as change sets, streams, components, snapshots, etc will not be discussed in any detail.

This guide will assume that you are a standard developer wanting to obtain the source code in the usual way, specifically we will not discuss these other methods for obtaining the source code:

* Using the RTC command line tools
* Using the RTC client JARs
